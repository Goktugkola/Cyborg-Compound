# Cyborg Compound

**Cyborg Compound** is a fast-paced 2D platformer fighter developed as my first game project during my studies in Digital Game Design. Built using the Godot Engine (version 3.6), the game offers a variety of mechanics for players to engage in quick duels with friends.

- **Punch Combos:** Offers a series of melee attacks for close combat.
- **Crouching:** Allows players to duck and evade ranged attacks.
- **Wall Jumping and Clinging:** Enables players to jump off and cling to walls, adding verticality to movement.
- **Dash and Air Dash:** Adds high-speed movement both on the ground and in the air.
